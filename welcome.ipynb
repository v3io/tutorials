    "The Iguazio Data Science Platform (**\"the platform\"**) is a fully integrated and secure data science platform as a service (PaaS), which simplifies development, accelerates performance, facilitates collaboration, and addresses operational challenges.\n",
    "The platform incorporates the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A data science workbench that includes Jupyter Notebook, integrated analytics engines, and Python packages\n",
    "- Model management with experiments tracking and automated pipeline capabilities\n",
    "- Managed data and machine-learning (ML) services over a scalable Kubernetes cluster\n",
    "- A real-time serverless functions framework &mdash; Nuclio\n",
    "- An extremely fast and secure data layer that supports SQL, NoSQL, time-series databases, files (simple objects), and streaming\n",
    "- Integration with third-party data sources such as Amazon S3, HDFS, SQL databases, and streaming or messaging protocols\n",
    "- Real-time dashboards based on Grafana\n",
