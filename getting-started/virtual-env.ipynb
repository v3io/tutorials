    "\n",
    "A Python virtual environment is a named, isolated, working copy of Python that maintains its own files, directories, and paths so that you can work with specific versions of libraries or Python itself without affecting other Python projects.\n",
    "Virtual environments make it easy to cleanly separate projects and avoid problems with different dependencies and version requirements across components.\n",
    "The conda command-line interface (CLI) is the preferred interface for managing installations and virtual environments with the Anaconda Python distribution.\n",
    "The Jupyter Notebook service of the Iguazio Data Science Platform (\"the platform\") comes pre-deployed with conda.\n",
    "This tutorial explains how to use conda to create a Python virtual environment that will be available as a custom kernel in Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "For general information about using conda to create virtual environments, see the [conda documentation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)."

    "1.  <a id=\"conda-virt-env-setup-step-create-terminal\"></a>Create a new terminal by selecting the **New Launcher** option (`+` icon) from the top action toolbar in the left sidebar, and then selecting **Terminal** from the main work area.<br>\n",
    "   The next steps should be executed from your new terminal, except where otherwise specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  <a id=\"conda-virt-env-setup-step-create-env\"></a>Create a new Python virtual environment by running the following command.\n",
    "    Replace `<environment name>` with your preferred virtual-environment name:\n",
    "    ```sh\n",
    "    conda create -n <environment name> ipykernel python=3.7\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",

    "    ```\n",
    "\n",

    "3. <a id=\"conda-virt-env-setup-step-install-packages\"></a>Install the desired Python packages by running the following command.\n",
    "   Replace `<environment name>` with the name of the environment that you created in the previous step and `<package>` with the name of your selected package, optionally followed by `=<version>`; you can specify multiple packages:\n",

    "   conda install -n <environment name> <package> [<package> ...]\n",
    "   ```\n",

    "4.  <a id=\"conda-virt-env-setup-step-export-env\"></a>Export your new virtual environment to an environment file in a platform data container by running the following command.\n",
    "    Replace `<container name>` with the name of a platform data container, `<directory path>` with an optional relative container-directories path, and `<environment name>` with the name of the environment that you created:\n",
    "    ```sh\n",
    "    conda env export -n <environment name> > /v3io/<container name>[/<directory path>]/<environment name>.yaml\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    <br>It's recommended that you save the environment to a virtual-environments directory in your running-user home directory (**users/&lt;running user&gt;**).\n",

    "    conda env export -n myenv > /v3io/users/$V3IO_USERNAME/virtual_env/myenv.yaml\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    You can use the `User` data mount to the running-user directory to shorten this command (see [Platform Data Containers](collect-n-explore.ipynb/#platform-data-containers)):\n",
    "    ```sh\n",
    "    conda env -n myenv export > /User/virtual_env/myenv.yaml\n",
