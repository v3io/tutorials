    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "[V3IO Frames](https://github.com/v3io/frames) (**\"Frames\"**) is a multi-model open-source data-access library, developed by Iguazio, which provides a unified high-performance DataFrame API for working with data in the data store of the Iguazio Data Science Platform (**\"the platform\"**).\n",
    "Frames currently supports the NoSQL (key/value), stream, and time-series (TSDB) data models via its `\"kv\"`, `\"stream\"`, and `\"tsdb\"` backends.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use Frames, you first need to import the **v3io_frames** library and create and initialize a client object &mdash; an instance of the`Client` class.<br>\n",
    "The `Client` class features the following object methods for supporting basic data operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `create` &mdash; create a new NoSQL or TSDB table or a stream (\"the backend\").\n",
    "- `delete` &mdash; delete the backend.\n",
    "- `read` &mdash; read data from the backend (as a pandas DataFrame or DataFrame iterator).\n",
    "- `write` &mdash; write one or more DataFrames to the backend.\n",
    "- `execute` &mdash; execute a command on the backend. Each backend may support multiple commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a detailed description of the Frames API, see the [Frames documentation](https://github.com/v3io/frames/blob/development/README.md).<br>\n",
    "For more help and usage details, use the internal API help &mdash; `<client object>.<command>?` in Jupyter Notebook or `print(<client object>.<command>.__doc__)`.<br>\n",
    "For example, the following command returns information about the read operation for a client object named `client`:\n",
    "```\n",
    "client.read?\n",
    "```"

   "cell_type": "markdown",

    "## Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "To use V3IO Frames, first ensure that your platform tenant has a shared tenant-wide instance of the V3IO Frames service.\n",
    "This can be done by a platform service administrator from the **Services** dashboard page.<br>\n",
    "Then, import the required libraries and create a Frames client object (an instance of the `Client` class), as demonstrated in the following code, which creates a client object named `client`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:**\n",
    "> - The client constructor's `container` parameter is set to `\"users\"` for accessing data in the platform's \"users\" data container.\n",
    "> - Because no authentication credentials are passed to the constructor, Frames will use the access token that's assigned to the `V3IO_ACCESS_KEY` environment variable.\n",
    ">   The platform's Jupyter Notebook service defines this variable automatically and initializes it to an access token for the running user of the service.\n",
    ">   You can pass different credentials by using the constructor's `token` parameter (platform access token) or `user` and `password` parameters (platform username and password)."
